Unsurprisingly, the use of this emulator hardly differs from the real hardware.  


__All basic functions remain self-explanatory__  
\* cold boot: press the power button on the pop-up keyboard  
\* warm boot: press the reset button on the pop-up keyboard  
\* insert disk: press the right disk drive to load any disk file found on the internet (.do, .dsk), after, perform a cold boot  
_note: most apple][ disks do not boot, it was not uncommon to keep a bootable disk image at hand reach._

__A handful new functions make the experience complete__  
- pasteboard: 
- 

use the pasteboard to paste any text through the text prompt (APPLESOFT BASIC LISTINGS, DOS COMMANDS, ASSEMBLY... anything)   Just mind that a 1 MHz computer does not ingest many characters per second, so be patient.
