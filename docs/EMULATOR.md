## EMULATOR Instructions

<img src="/res/appleIIplus_bck_650.png?raw=true" width=39% align="left" />
Unsurprisingly, the use of this emulator hardly differs from the real hardware.<br><br>

__All basic functions remain self-explanatory__  
\* the pop-up keyboard toggles SHIFT, CTRL and REPT, enabling key combinations  
\* warm boot: press the reset button on the pop-up keyboard

\* insert disk: press the right disk drive to load any disk file found on the internet (.do, .dsk), after, perform a cold boot  
_note: most apple][ disks do not boot, it was not uncommon to keep a bootable disk image at hand reach._  


__A handful new functions make the experience complete__  
\* pasteboard: use the pasteboard to paste any text through the text prompt, just mind that a 1 MHz computer takes this slowly.  
\* monitor: cycle color mode through apple color, black/white, green and amber  
\* cold boot: press the power button on the pop-up keyboard  
\* pause: freeze/unfreeze CPU

## Appendix

__Keyboard functions__

The **CTRL** and **SHIFT** keys generate no codes by themselves, but only after the codes produced by other keys.

The **REPT** key is pressed alone produces a duplicate of the last code that was generated.
If you press and hold down the **REPT** key while you are holding down a character key, it will act as if you are pressing that key repeatedly at a rate of 10 pressess each second. This repetition will cease when you release either the character key or **REPT**.

The POWER light at the lower left-hand corner is an indicator lamp to show when the power to the Apple is on.
