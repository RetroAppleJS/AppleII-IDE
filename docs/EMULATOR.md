## EMULATOR Instructions

<img src="/res/appleIIplus_bck_650.png?raw=true" width=39% align="left" />
While the end-user experience with emulator hardly differs from the real hardware, which in fact should not hinder anyone familiar with the Apple II, there are some essential differences, mostly to your benefit, but there are some downsides too.<br><br>

__All basic functions remain self-explanatory__  
\* the pop-up keyboard toggles SHIFT, CTRL and REPT, enabling key combinations  
\* warm boot: press the reset button on the pop-up keyboard

\* insert disk: press the right disk drive to load any disk file found on the internet (.do, .dsk), after, perform a cold boot  
_note: most apple][ disks do not boot, it was not uncommon to keep a bootable disk image at hand reach._  


__A handful new functions make the experience complete__  
\* pasteboard: use the pasteboard to paste any text through the text prompt, just mind that a 1MHz computer takes this slowly.  
\* monitor: cycle color mode through apple color, black/white, green and amber  
\* cold boot: press the power button on the pop-up keyboard  
\* pause: freeze/unfreeze CPU

__The 1MHz trick__
  

__Impossible sound emulation__ 
However simple sound production was designed on the Apple II, since 1997, JavaScript maintained 1ms as the **highest achievable timing accuracy**, while the 6502 CPU was clocked at approximately 1MHz or 1/1000ms cycles.  In other words, a JavaScript cannot emulate any sound above it's nyquist frequency of 500Hz, while the most commonly used Apple II Beep sound is a 1KHz square wave.

W3C recently started to worry about this limitation by proposing a new spec called ["High Resolution Time" or hr-time](https://w3c.github.io/hr-time/), but because of alleged malicious capability like [CACHE-ATTACKS] and [SPECTRE], W3C recommends to purposefully mess-up it's accuracy by reducing resolution, adding jitter, or by any other piggish means that probably never will provide us anything near to 1Âµs clock accuracy.  Nobody would have thought that an Apple II made in 1978 ðŸ¦–, due to it's highly accurate clock of 1,022727 MHz could up till today present a cybersecurity risk 44 years later, let alone an emulated Apple II ! ðŸ¤¨

Last but not least, we actually do not need 1Âµs clock accuracy for sound emulation.  The speaker can be switched from 'off' to 'on' and back to 'off' by reading the address location twice.  Knowing that frequencies above 20000 Hz remain unhearable, we only should mind about toggling the speaker every 50 cycles / 2 = 25 cycles.  In conclusion, we only need 25Âµs or 0.025ms timer accuracy, which in future may be achieved with High Resolution Time control logic, but since this spec came only in 2022, we can only wait and see.

### Hard-wired keyboard functions ###

<img src="../res/appleIIplus_kbd_650.png?raw=true" width=40% align="right"/> 

**CTRL** and **SHIFT** keys generate no codes by themselves, but only after the codes produced by other keys.

The **REPT** key is pressed alone produces a duplicate of the last code that was generated.
If you press and hold down the **REPT** key while you are holding down a character key, it will act as if you are pressing that key repeatedly at a rate of 10 pressess each second. This repetition will cease when you release either the character key or **REPT**.

The **POWER** light at the lower left-hand corner is an indicator lamp to show when the power to the Apple is on.
As the physical power switch is located below the keyboard, for convenience, we turned the **POWER** light into a cold boot button.

### Firmware keyboard functions ###

**CTRL-S** triggers the **STOP-LIST** feature, which is pausing any screen text printing at every RETURN code. Screen printing resumes after pressing any key, unless **CTRL-C** is pressed, which breaks screen printing and goes back to the program that is sending output.

**CTRL-G** does not print any character, instead it produces a tone of 100Hz in the speaker during 0.1s.

**CTRL-X** breaks an input line, forgets all what was typed and starts a new input line.

|    Escape codes    |
| ------------------ |

When pressing the **ESC** key, Apples firmware goes into _escape mode_. In this mode, 11 keys have separate meanings called _escape codes_.

**ESC A**
: moves cursor one space forward  
**ESC B**
: moves cursor one space back  
**ESC C**
: moves cursor one line down  
**ESC D**
: moves cursor one line up  
**ESC E**
: clear until end of line while screen text printing  
**ESC F**
: clear until end of screen while screen text printing  
**ESC @**
: home and clear - clears entire window and places cursor in upper left corner  
**ESC K**
: same as ESC A - move cursor one right  
**ESC J**
: same as ESC B - move cursor one left  
**ESC M**
: same as ESC C - move cursor one down  
**ESC I**
: same as ESC D - move cursor one up
