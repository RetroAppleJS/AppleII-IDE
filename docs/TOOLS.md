## TOOLS Explained

In the [tools folder](https://github.com/RetroAppleJS/AppleII-IDE/tree/main/tools), we keep a collection of helpers to simulate, better understand or automate processes supporting the development of the IDE.  Every tool is designed to run in the browser, just like the IDE, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### DOCS_updater.html

We aim to have all the documentation available in markdown format, for easy online access and editing in GitHub.  Docs_updater.html was designed to read all the markdown documentation available online in this project, and compile a JavaScript include file that would provide a perfect copy of all the available documentation inside the IDE.  The following diagram shows how clearly the steps:  
* Fetch Readme.me file from GitHub
* extract all \*.md file links located in /docs
* fetch all listed .md files
* convert each to HTML and append to JavaScript file
* preview
* download the JavaScript file
* overwite file in /docs folder.

        └──────────────┘  │  └───────────────────┘   │   └──────────────────┘     └────────────────────┘
                          │    loop until done       │
                          └──────────────────────────┘
        </div>

/<ins> **!** </ins>\ mind that DOCS_updater.html only captures the latest version of the markdown files 2-10 min after the last edits.  This must be the time GitHub requires to update the raw files on the server.

### Monitor_palette.html

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroAppleJS/AppleII-IDE/main/res/palette.png" width=30% align=left />Color graphics on the Apple II never really impressed, as it could render only 4 distinct colors in high-resolution (green, orange, violet, blue).   Surely, owners of monochrome green or amber monitors sometimes longed for some color, but none at the time saw any advantage in using an expensive color monitor or a blurry and color-bleeding TV against the razor-sharp image produced by a genuine monochrome apple monitor.  

The emulator's display offers an easy switching capability to render color, black&white, green and amber as some graphics really look nicer in color or monochrome.  e.g. fonts rendered on a hires screen produce very disturbing color fringing artifacts, which make the letters unreadable in color mode; any monochrome setting is more appropriate in this case. 

This tool was made to test and assure the best image rendering approximation with these respective monitors.
It produces a Javascript snippet that seamlessly maps the Apple II colors to the different monochrome versions.  This snippet is located in [EMU_apple2video.js](https://github.com/RetroAppleJS/AppleII-IDE/blob/main/res/EMU_apple2video.js).

### Tab_ctrl_v*.html

This is a fully client-side tab controller that remembers the last clicked tab after a page reload, based on the URI fragment identifier.  e.g. www.example.com/index.html#tab1
Subsequent versions of this tab control show increasingly interesting capabilities and design options.

### ConverHGR.html

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RetroAppleJS/AppleII-IDE/main/res/HGR_Venus.png" align=left width=30% />This handy tool converts the most common image file types to an Apple II HGR color bitmaps.  Dithering achieves a way to convert images from high color-depths to lower depths, but Apple II graphics require a special twist to gracefully overcome inherent 'Wozniackian' artifacts.  Buttons and tuning sliders will help you model the most acceptable conversion.  For developers, the challenge will be to optimize conversion quality and speed, as this very algorithm will serve inside the webcam capture tool.
