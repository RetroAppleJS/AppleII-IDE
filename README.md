## Introduction

This is a complete AppleII+ IDE toolchain with an assembler, debugger, emulator and CPU reference manual bundled in one client-side JavaScript web application.  All you need is a browser.  

The idea is simple.  Retro-computing enthusiasts want a frictionless implementation of their concepts.  Headaces associated with setting up a working system is especially not the sort of old memories one wants to recall.

Enjoy the beauty of 8-bit computing on a 6502 CPU, it's math tricks and deceivingly simple instruction set.  Alongside the development of this IDE, it is crucial to have a 6502 assembler codebase handy that can be edited, compiled, ran and debugged seamlessly.  Please have peek inside [this folder](https://github.com/flyingzebra/AppleII-IDE/tree/main/asm_code_examples).

## Credits

The basic building blocks originate from Thomas Skibo (2014) for the AppleII+ emulator, Mag. Norbert Landsteiner (2005) for the 6502 assembler and Freddy Vandriessche (2020) for gluing the IDE together, and introducing new sneaky bugs, for the real connaisseurs ;o)

## Getting Started

1) Tap the 'generate' button
2) Tap the 'to emulator' button
3) Inside the emulator, type G6000 to run the code, that's it !
