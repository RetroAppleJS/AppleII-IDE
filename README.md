## Introduction

This is a complete AppleII+ IDE toolchain with an assembler, debugger and emulator environment and CPU reference manual al in one client-side JavaScript web application.  All you need to run this application is a browser.  The idea is simple, retro-computing enthusiasts want to get their ideas implemented with minimal friction.  Frustration is especially not the sort of old memories one wants to recall here, rather the beauty of 8-bit computing, it's math tricks and deceivingly simple instruction set.

## Credits

The basic building blocks originate from Thomas Skibo (2014) for the AppleII+ emulator, Mag. Norbert Landsteiner (2005) for the 6502 assembler and Freddy Vandriessche (2020) for gluing the IDE together, including sneaky bugs for real connoisseurs ;o)
