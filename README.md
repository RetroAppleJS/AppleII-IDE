## Introduction

This is a complete AppleII+ IDE toolchain with an assembler, debugger, emulator and CPU reference manual bundled in one client-side JavaScript web application.  All you need is a browser.

The idea behind this project is simple: Retrocomputing enthusiasts want a frictionless implementation of their concepts.  Issues associated with setting up a working system is especially not the sort of painful old memories one may wish to recall, this project aims quite the opposite.

Enjoy the beauty of 8-bit computing on a 6502 CPU, it's math tricks and deceivingly simple instruction set.  Alongside the development of this IDE, it is crucial to have a 6502 assembler codebase handy that can be edited, compiled, ran and debugged seamlessly. 

## Getting started

1) Inside the assembler, tap the **'generate'** button
2) Tap the **'to emulator'** button
3) Inside the emulator, tap the **'paste'** button
4) Type **G6000** to run the code at address 6000h, that's it !

Other assembler listings can be found in this folder https://github.com/flyingzebra/AppleII-IDE/tree/main/asm_code_examples, feel free to copy any of those in the left pane of the assembler and procedd as described above.
