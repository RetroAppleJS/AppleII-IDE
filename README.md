# The Apple II IDE

<img src="/res/appleii+_bck_650.png?raw=true" width=40% align="left" />



## Introduction

This is a complete AppleII+ IDE toolchain with an assembler, debugger, emulator and CPU reference manual bundled in one client-side JavaScript web application.  All you need is a browser.  

The idea is simple.  Retrocomputing enthusiasts want a frictionless implementation of their concepts.  Headaces associated with setting up a working system is especially not the sort of old memories one wants to recall.

Enjoy the beauty of 8-bit computing on a 6502 CPU, it's math tricks and deceivingly simple instruction set.  Alongside the development of this IDE, it is crucial to have a 6502 assembler codebase handy that can be edited, compiled, ran and debugged seamlessly. 

## Credits

The basic building blocks originate from Thomas Skibo (2014) for the AppleII+ emulator, Mag. Norbert Landsteiner (2005) for the 6502 assembler and Freddy Vandriessche (2020) for gluing the IDE together, and introducing new sneaky bugs, for the real connaisseurs ;o)

## Getting started

1) Inside the assembler, tap the **'generate'** button
2) Tap the **'to emulator'** button
3) Inside the emulator, tap the **'paste'** button
4) Type **G6000** to run the code at address 6000h, that's it !

Other assembler listings can be found in [this folder](https://github.com/flyingzebra/AppleII-IDE/tree/main/asm_code_examples), feel free to copy any of those in the left pane of the assembler and procedd as described above.
