# The Apple II+ IDE

<img src="/res/appleii+_bck_650.png?raw=true" style="zoom:30%;" align="left" />



## Introduction

This is a complete AppleII+ IDE toolchain with an assembler, debugger and emulator environment and CPU reference manual in one client-side JavaScript web application.  All you need for running this, is a browser.  The idea is simple, retro-computing enthusiasts want a frictionless implementation of their ideas.  Frustration and headaces on setting up the building blocks is especially not the sort of old memories one wants to recall.  Enjoy the beauty of 8-bit computing on a 6502 CPU, it's math tricks and deceivingly simple instruction set.  Alongside the development of this IDE, it is crucial to have a 6502 assembler codebase handy that can be edited, compiled and run and debugged seamlessly. Please have peek inside folder **asm_code_examples**.

## Credits

The basic building blocks originate from Thomas Skibo (2014) for the AppleII+ emulator, Mag. Norbert Landsteiner (2005) for the 6502 assembler and Freddy Vandriessche (2020) for gluing the IDE together, and introducing new sneaky bugs, for the real connaisseurs ;o)
